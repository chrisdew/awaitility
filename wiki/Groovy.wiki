#summary Groovy API for Awaitility

= Groovy API =

We have also added a Groovy API that allows you to write 

{{{
await().until { numberOfReceivedMessages() > 3 }
}}}

To make this work you simply extend the `AwaitilitySupport` class that is provided in the awaitility-groovy module. Example:

{{{
class AwaitilitySupportTest extends AwaitilitySupport {

  @Test
  def void groovyClosureSupport() throws Exception {
    ... 

    await().until { getValue() == 1 }
}}}}

Use the following Maven dependency:

{{{
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.jayway.awaitility</groupId>
    <artifactId>awaitility-groovy</artifactId>
    <version>${awaitility.version}</version>
</dependency>
}}}
