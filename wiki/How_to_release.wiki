= How to release =

  # Run `mvn release:prepare -Prelease`
  # Run `mvn release:perform -Prelease`
  # Log in to [https://oss.sonatype.org Sonatype]. 
  # Follow the [https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide Sonatype release directions] in bullet 10.
  # Upload the artifacts to the download page.
  # Update the front page and the getting started page.
  # Send a message to the mailing-list announcing the new release.

The release is then automatically synced to Maven central (the sync process runs hourly).
